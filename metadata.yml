name: A Coarse-to-Fine Labels Learning Framework for Metabolic Pathway Prediction
description: |-
  Effective prediction of the metabolic pathways
  of compounds can greatly accelerate the progress and
  efficiency of disease research. However, most existing
  machine learning or deep learning models focus solely on
  predicting coarse-grained pathway types, which fails to meet
  the practical needs of researchers in this field who require
  more fine-grained metabolic pathway predictions for
  detailed mechanistic understanding and drug development
  applications. In this study, we propose a coarse-to-fine labels
  learning framework for metabolic pathway prediction called
  C2F-PathNet, which simultaneously predicts coarse-grained
  and fine-grained metabolic pathway types of compounds, supporting up to three levels of labels. C2F-PathNet adopts a
  multi-task learning framework, where a shared feature
  extractor learns common representations for all levels, followed by level-specific branch modules incorporating a
  dual-layer feature fusion mechanism to capture level-specific
  features. Furthermore, a hierarchy-guided mechanism and a
  consistency loss are employed to further enhance fine- grained predictions. Experiments on a KEGG dataset
  comprising 5,626 compounds with up to three levels of
  pathway labels demonstrate the superior performance of the
  proposed C2F-PathNet through both ablation and
  comparative experimental analyses. Transferring C2F- PathNet as a pre-trained model to a constructed NAFLD
  (Non-Alcoholic Fatty Liver Disease) dataset further validates
  its generalization capability in specific domains, with F1- scores reaching 0.881, 0.807, and 0.727 at level1, level2, and
  level3, respectively, providing valuable insights for disease
  mechanism research and drug discovery.
